                An extension to POP3 allowing opened connections to be 
                shelved, avoiding the const of repeated TCP and TLS handshakes 
                when polling for new messages and for message deletes to be 
                committed without having to disconnect.

            <t>
                When polling for new messages in a <xref target="RFC1939">POP3</xref> 
                mailbox, both client and server need to repeatedly re-negotitate TCP and
                TLS and re-authenticate every time the client attempts to poll for new messages.
                By allowing a client to keep an underying connection open instead of closing
                it down, the client is at liberty to resume using the opened connection at 
                a later time and so avoid the burden of all the steps needed to reconnect.
            </t>

            <t>
                This document specifies an extension that enables this mode of operation.
                It introduces a new SLEEP state, alongside the established
                states, with commands to enter and leave this new state. During the SLEEP state, 
                the client remains authenticated and the underlying connection remains open, but 
                the associated mailbox is unlocked and inaccessable.
            </t>

            <t>
                The underlying connection that remains open includes the TLS channel if present, 
                including if that channel was opened by an explicit <xref target="RFC2595">STLS command</xref>
                or implied by <xref target="RFC8314">use of TCP port 995</xref>.
            </t>
                
            <t>
                 Furthermore, the command to 
                leave the TRANSACTION state and enter SLEEP will also commit any pending message deletes
                made with the DELE command that would otherwise only be committed at the QUIT command.
            </t>

            <t>
                POP3 is designed to work on a simple bulk-download-and-delete model, 
                eschewing more advanced features such as folder management. This 
                extension is compatible with that model as the high-level operation of
                client and server is unchanged, only adding the ability to shelve an
                opened connection between polls.

    <section anchor="sleepstate" title="The SLEEP State">
      <t>
      This RFC introduces the SLEEP state, alongside the established states of AUTHORIZATION, TRANSACTION and UPDATE. An 
      opened connection enters the SLEEP state on a +OK success response to a SLEE command and leaves it on a +OK response
      to a WAKE or QUIT command.
      </t>

      <t>
      During the SLEEP state, the server MUST support these commands: NOOP, QUIT, WAKE.
      </t>

      <t>
        <list hangIndent="10" style="empty">
          <t>
            NOTE: This document STRONGLY encourages that during a sleep state, service implementations return error
            responses to any command other that the three listed above. This will assist those developing clients 
            from wrongly assuming commands such STAT or UIDL could be used during a SLEEP state to poll for new messages.
          </t>

          <t>
            NOTE: This document STRONGLY encourages those services that place a lock on a mailbox during a TRANSACTION state
            to release those locks during a SLEEP state and allow other concurrent requests.
            It is permitted for the WAKE command to fail with a "-ERR [INUSE]" failure response if a separate connection has taken the
            lock for the mailbox during the SLEEP state.

        <t>"CAPA" <xref target="RFC2449" /> is not on the list of commands that are valid to use during the SLEEP state.</t>

        <t>
        Registered capabilities include a statement to which states each capability may be announced in, often using "both" as a
        shorthand for "both the AUTHOIZATION and TRANSACTION states". As this document does not introduce a new state when the
        CAPA command may be used, this document does not change the meaning of the capabilities registered.

      </section>

    <section anchor="slecommand" title="The SLEE Command">
      <t>
      The POP3 SLEE command requests that the POP3 service take the following steps:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>
          All actions that take place on a successful QUIT command and UPDATE state, except for closing down the channel over which 
          commands and responses are sent and received.
          </t>

          <t>
          The connection transitions to the SLEEP state.
          </t>
        </list>      
     </t>

     <t>
     If the service cannot perform these steps, it MUST return an error (-ERR) response and leave the state of the mailbox and
     opened connection unchanged.
     </t>

     <t>
     On the succesful completion of the SLEE command including successful transition to the SLEEP state, the service MUST respond
     with a success response (+OK) to indicate to the client it's request was succesful. A client MUST wait for a response
     before sending additional commands, regardless of the PIPELINING capability.
     </t>

      <t>
        <list hangIndent="10" style="empty">
          <t>
            NOTE: Messages flagged for deletion by <xref target="RFC1939">DELE</xref> are finally deleted by the SLEE command
            as well as by the QUIT command. Other POP3 extensions might allow for a mailbox to be modifed, but similar to 
            DELE, the modification is documented to be diferred until committed by a QUIT command. In this case, those
            modifications would be committed by the SLEE command too. The only difference between SLEE is QUIT is that with SLEE,
            the communciations channel, including TCP and TLS, remain open.
