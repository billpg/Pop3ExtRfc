    <abstract>
      <t>An extension to POP3 allowing opened connections to be shelved
       via a sleeping state, avoiding the const of repeated TCP and TLS 
       handshakes when polling for new messages.</t>
    </abstract>
  </front>

  <middle>
    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>When polling new new messages in a <xref target="RFC1939">POP3</xref> 
      mailbox, both client and server need to repeatedly re-negotitate TCP and
      TLS connections as well as re-authenticating every time. Clients need to find a
      balance between polling too quickly and placing a corresponding burden
      on systems, and polling too slowly and messages not arriving in a timely 
      manner.</t>

      <t>By allowing a client, once it has completed downloading and deleting 
      messages from the mailbox, to put a connection to sleep instread of closing
      it down, the client is at liberty to resume using the opened connection
      and so avoid the burden of all the steps needed to reconnect.</t>

      <t>This extension introduces a new state, SLEEP, alongside the established
      states: AUTHORIZATION, TRANSACTION and UPDATE.</t>

      <t>POP3 is designed to work on a simple bulk-download-and-delete model, 
      eschewing more advanced features such as folder management. This 
      extension is compatible with that model as the high-level operation of
      client and server is unchanged, only adding the ability to shelve
      opened connections between polls.</t>

      <section title="Requirements Language">
        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",

              The SLEEP capability indicates the optional SLEE and WAKE commands are available and the SLEEP state
              is supported.

    <section anchor="sleepstate" title="The SLEEP State">
      <t>
      This RFC introduces the SLEEP state, alongside the established states of AUTHORIZATION, TRANSACTION and UPDATE. An 
      opened connection enters the SLEEP state on a +OK success response to a SLEE command and leaves it on a +OK response
      to a WAKE or QUIT command.
      </t>

      <t>
      During the SLEEP state, the server MUST support these commands: NOOP, QUIT, WAKE.
      </t>

      <t>
        <list hangIndent="10" style="empty">
          <t>
            NOTE: This document STRONGLY encourages that during a sleep state, service implementations return error
            responses to any command other that the three listed above, even if that service could perform the requested 
            command. This will assist those developing clients from wrongly assuming commands such STAT or UIDL could 
            be used during a SLEEP state to poll for new messages.
          </t>

          <t>
            NOTE: This document STRONGLY encourages services that place a lock on a mailbox during a TRANSACTION state,
            rejecting concurrent requests, release those locks during a SLEEP state and allow other concurrent requests.
            It is permitted for the WAKE command to fail with a -ERR failure response if a separate connection has taken the
            lock for the mailbox during the SLEEP state.
          </t>

      <section anchor="other_capabilities" title="Considerations for other capabilities">
        <t>CAPA is not on the list of commands that are valid to use during the SLEEP state.</t>

        <t>
        Registered capabilities include a statement to which states each capability may be announced in, often using "both" as a
        shorthand for "both the AUTHOIZATION and TRANSACTION states". As this document does not introduce a new state when the
        CAPA command may be used, this document does not change the meaning of the capabilities registered.
        </t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section anchor="slecommand" title="The SLEE Command">
      <t>
      The POP3 SLEE command requests that the POP3 service take the following steps:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>
          All actions that take place on a successful QUIT command and UPDATE state, except for closing down the channel over which 
          commands and responses are sent and received.
          </t>

          <t>
          The connection transitions to the SLEEP state.
          </t>
        </list>      
     </t>

     <t>
     If the service cannot perform these steps, it MUST return an error (-ERR) response and leave the state of the mailbox and
     opened connection unchanged.
     </t>

     <t>
     On the succesful completion of the SLEE command including successful transition to the SLEEP state, the service MUST respond
     with a success response (+OK) to indicate to the client it's request was succesful. A client MUST wait for a response
     before sending additional commands, regardless of the PIPELINING capability.
     </t>

        <list hangIndent="10" style="empty">
          <t>
            NOTE: Messages flagged for deletion by <xref target="RFC1939">DELE</xref> are finally deleted by the SLEE command
            as well as by the QUIT command. Other POP3 extensions might allow for a mailbox to be modifed, but similar to 
            DELE, the modification is documented to be diferred until committed by a QUIT command. In this case, those
            modifications would be committed by the SLEE command too. The only difference between SLEE is QUIT is that with SLEE,
            the communciations channel, including TCP and TLS, remain open.

v03 2007-03-09  EBD   Added comments on null IANA sections and fixed heading capitalization.
                      Modified comments around figure to reflect non-implementation of
                      figure indent control.  Put in reference using anchor="DOMINATION".
                      Fixed up the date specification comments to reflect current truth.
