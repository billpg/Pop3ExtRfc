                    POP3 - The SLEEP State Extension
                     draft-billpg-pop3-slee-wake-00

Abstract

   An extension to POP3 allowing opened connections to be shelved via a
   sleeping state, avoiding the const of repeated TCP and TLS handshakes
   when polling for new messages.

1.  Introduction

   When polling new new messages in a POP3 [RFC1939] mailbox, both
   client and server need to repeatedly re-negotitate TCP and TLS
   connections as well as re-authenticating every time.  Clients need to
   find a balance between polling too quickly and placing a
   corresponding burden on systems, and polling too slowly and messages
   not arriving in a timely manner.

   By allowing a client, once it has completed downloading and deleting
   messages from the mailbox, to put a connection to sleep instread of
   closing it down, the client is at liberty to resume using the opened
   connection and so avoid the burden of all the steps needed to
   reconnect.

   This extension introduces a new state, SLEEP, alongside the
   established states: AUTHORIZATION, TRANSACTION and UPDATE.

   POP3 is designed to work on a simple bulk-download-and-delete model,
   eschewing more advanced features such as folder management.  This
   extension is compatible with that model as the high-level operation

   of client and server is unchanged, only adding the ability to shelve
   opened connections between polls.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Capability

   A service implementing this extension indicates support by including
   the capability "SLEEPING" in response to a CAPA command.

2.1.  SLEEPING Capability

   CAPA tag:
           SLEEPING

   Arguments:
           none

   Added commands:
           SLEE, WAKE

   Announced states / possible differences:
           both / no

   Commands valid in states:
           SLEE in TRANSACTION, WAKE in SLEEP

   Specification reference:
           This document

   Discussion:
           The SLEEP capability indicates the optional SLEE and WAKE
           commands are available and the SLEEP state is supported.

3.  The SLEEP State

   This RFC introduces the SLEEP state, alongside the established states
   of AUTHORIZATION, TRANSACTION and UPDATE.  An opened connection
   enters the SLEEP state on a +OK success response to a SLEE command
   and leaves it on a +OK response to a WAKE or QUIT command.

   During the SLEEP state, the server MUST support these commands: NOOP,
   QUIT, WAKE.

Internet-Draft                POP3 - SLEEP                 December 2021


      NOTE: This document STRONGLY encourages that during a sleep state,
      service implementations return error responses to any command
      other that the three listed above, even if that service could
      perform the requested command.  This will assist those developing
      clients from wrongly assuming commands such STAT or UIDL could be
      used during a SLEEP state to poll for new messages.

      NOTE: This document STRONGLY encourages services that place a lock
      on a mailbox during a TRANSACTION state, rejecting concurrent
      requests, release those locks during a SLEEP state and allow other
      concurrent requests.  It is permitted for the WAKE command to fail
      with a -ERR failure response if a separate connection has taken
      the lock for the mailbox during the SLEEP state.

3.1.  Considerations for other capabilities

   CAPA is not on the list of commands that are valid to use during the
   SLEEP state.

   Registered capabilities include a statement to which states each
   capability may be announced in, often using "both" as a shorthand for
   "both the AUTHOIZATION and TRANSACTION states".  As this document
   does not introduce a new state when the CAPA command may be used,
   this document does not change the meaning of the capabilities
   registered.

4.  The SLEE Command

   The POP3 SLEE command requests that the POP3 service take the
   following steps:

   o  All actions that take place on a successful QUIT command and
      UPDATE state, except for closing down the channel over which
      commands and responses are sent and received.

   o  The connection transitions to the SLEEP state.

   If the service cannot perform these steps, it MUST return an error
   (-ERR) response and leave the state of the mailbox and opened
   connection unchanged.

   On the succesful completion of the SLEE command including successful
   transition to the SLEEP state, the service MUST respond with a
   success response (+OK) to indicate to the client it's request was
   succesful.  A client MUST wait for a response before sending
   additional commands, regardless of the PIPELINING capability.

      NOTE: Messages flagged for deletion by DELE [RFC1939] are finally
      deleted by the SLEE command as well as by the QUIT command.  Other
      POP3 extensions might allow for a mailbox to be modifed, but
      similar to DELE, the modification is documented to be diferred
      until committed by a QUIT command.  In this case, those
      modifications would be committed by the SLEE command too.  The
      only difference between SLEE is QUIT is that with SLEE, the
      communciations channel, including TCP and TLS, remain open.

5.  Simple List

   List styles: 'empty', 'symbols', 'letters', 'numbers', 'hanging',
   'format'.

   o  First bullet

   o  Second bullet

   You can write text here as well.

6.  Figures

   Figures should not exceed 69 characters wide to allow for the indent
   of sections.

                 Preamble text - can be omitted or empty.

   +-----------------------+
   | Use XML, be Happy :-) |
   |_______________________|

        Cross-references allowed in pre- and postamble. [min_ref].

                                 Figure 1

   The CDATA means you don't need to escape meta-characters (especially
   < (&lt;) and & (&amp;)) but is not essential.  Figures may also have
   a title attribute but it won't be displayed unless there is also an
   anchor.  White space, both horizontal and vertical, is significant in
   figures even if you don't use CDATA.

7.  Subsections and Tables

7.1.  A Subsection

   By default 3 levels of nesting show in table of contents but that can
   be adjusted with the value of the "tocdepth" processing instruction.

Internet-Draft                POP3 - SLEEP                 December 2021


7.2.  Tables

   .. are very similar to figures:

     Tables use ttcol to define column headers and widths.  Every cell
                  then has a "c" element for its content.

                          +----------+----------+
                          | ttcol #1 | ttcol #2 |
                          +----------+----------+
                          |   c #1   |   c #2   |
                          |   c #3   |   c #4   |
                          |   c #5   |   c #6   |
                          +----------+----------+

                      which is a very simple example.

                       Table 1: A Very Simple Table

8.  More about Lists

   Lists with 'hanging labels': the list item is indented the amount of
   the hangIndent:

   short   With a label shorter than the hangIndent.

   fantastically long label  With a label longer than the hangIndent.

   vspace_trick
           Forces the new item to start on a new line.

   Simulating more than one paragraph in a list item using <vspace>:

   a.  First, a short item.

   b.  Second, a longer list item.

       And something that looks like a separate pararaph..

   Simple indented paragraph using the "empty" style:

      The quick, brown fox jumped over the lazy dog and lived to fool
      many another hunter in the great wood in the west.

8.1.  Numbering Lists across Lists and Sections

   Numbering items continuously although they are in separate <list>
   elements, maybe in separate sections using the "format" style and a
   "counter" variable.

   First list:

   R1  #1

   R2  #2

   R3  #3

   Specify the indent explicitly so that all the items line up nicely.

   Second list:

   R4  #4

   R5  #5

   R6  #6

8.2.  Where the List Numbering Continues

   List continues here.

   Third list:

   R7  #7

   R8  #8

   R9  #9

   R10 #10

   The end of the list.

   The <artwork> element has a number of extra attributes that can be
   used to substitute a more aesthetically pleasing rendition into HTML
   output while continuing to use the ASCII art version in the text and
   nroff outputs (see the xml2rfc README for details).  It also has a
   "type" attribute.  This is currently ignored except in the case
   'type="abnf"'.  In this case the "artwork" is expected to contain a
   piece of valid Augmented Backus-Naur Format (ABNF) grammar.  This
   will be syntax checked by xml2rfc and any errors will cause a fatal
   error if the "strict" processing instruction is set to "yes".  The
   ABNF will also be colorized in HTML output to highlight the syntactic
   components.  Checking of additional "types" may be provided in future
   versions of xml2rfc.


   /**** an example C program */

   {
       int i;

       printf("program arguments are:\n");
       for (i = 0; i < argc; i++) {
           printf("%d: \"%s\"\n", i, argv[i]);

11.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

   All drafts are required to have an IANA considerations section (see
   the update of RFC 2434 [I-D.narten-iana-considerations-rfc2434bis]

   for a guide).  If the draft does not require IANA to do anything, the
   section contains an explicit statement that this is the case (as
   above).  If there are no requirements for IANA, the section will be
   removed during conversion into an RFC by the RFC Editor.

12.  Security Considerations

   All drafts are required to have a security considerations section.
