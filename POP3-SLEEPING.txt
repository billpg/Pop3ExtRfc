                       POP3 - SLEEPING Extension
                     draft-billpg-pop3-sleeping-00

Abstract

   An extension to POP3 allowing opened connections to be shelved,
   avoiding the cost of repeated TCP and TLS handshakes when polling for
   new messages and for message deletes to be committed without having
   to disconnect.

1.  Introduction

   When polling for new messages in a POP3 [RFC1939] mailbox, both
   client and server need to repeatedly re-negotitate TCP and TLS and
   re-authenticate every time the client attempts to poll for new
   messages.  By allowing a client to keep an underlying connection open
   instead of closing it down, the client is at liberty to pick up an
   opened connection at a later time and so avoid the burden of all the
   steps needed to reconnect.

   With this extension, the client may, instead of using the QUIT
   command, send a SLEE command.  This will, like QUIT, commit those
   requests to delete messages.  However, unlike the QUIT command, it
   will keep the underlying connection open, which the client may keep
   shelved.  After some time has passed and the client wishes to poll
   for new messages again, the client may find it already has an opened
   connection shelved and send it a WAKE command.  The server will
   refresh its state and allow access to a new set of messages.

   This document specifies an extension that enables this mode of
   operation.  It introduces a new SLEEP state, alongside the
   established states, with commands to enter and leave this new state.
   During the SLEEP state, the client remains authenticated and the
   underlying connection remains open, but the associated mailbox is
   unlocked and inaccessable.

   The underlying connection that remains open includes the TLS channel
   if present, including if that channel was opened by an explicit STLS
   command [RFC2595] or implied by use of TCP port 995 [RFC8314].

   POP3 is designed to work within the simple bulk-download-and-delete
   model, eschewing more advanced features such as folder management.
   This extension maintains this model as the high-level operation of
   client and server is unchanged, only adding the ability to shelve an
   opened connection between polls.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Capability

   A service implementing this extension indicates support by including
   the capability "SLEEPING" in response to a CAPA command.

2.1.  SLEEPING Capability

   CAPA tag:
           SLEEPING

   Arguments:
           none

   Added commands:
           SLEE, WAKE

   Announced states / possible differences:
           both / no

   Commands valid in states:
           SLEE in TRANSACTION, WAKE in SLEEP

   Specification reference:

   Discussion:
           The presence of the "SLEEPING" capability indicates the SLEEP
           state is supported and that the SLEE and WAKE commands are
           supported to enter and leave this new state.

3.  The SLEEP State

   This RFC introduces the SLEEP state, alongside the established states
   of AUTHORIZATION, TRANSACTION and UPDATE.

   During a SLEEP state, the underlying TCP and TLS connections remain
   open and active.  Access to the mailbox is not possible but the
   client nonetheless remains authenticated during this time.

   A client requests a state transition from TRANSACTION to SLEEP by a
   SLEE command, and from SLEEP to TRANSACTION by a WAKE command.  The
   server responds with a success +OK response to either command to
   indicate the state transition is complete, or with an error -ERR
   response to indicate it can not transition state at this time and the
   connection remains in the previous state.

   During the SLEEP state, the server MUST support the commands NOOP,
   QUIT and WAKE as described below.  The server SHOULD respond with an
   error -ERR response to any other command that is not documented as
   valid for the SLEEP state.

   NOTE: This document STRONGLY encourages those services that place a
   lock on a mailbox during a TRANSACTION state to release those locks
   during a SLEEP state and allow other concurrent requests, re-aquiring
   that lock on the WAKE command.  It is permitted for the WAKE command
   to fail with a "-ERR [INUSE]" failure response if a separate
   connection has taken the lock for the mailbox during the SLEEP state.

4.  Considerations for documented capabilities

   CAPA [RFC2449] is not on the list of commands that are valid to use
   during the SLEEP state.  Registered capabilities include a statement
   to which states each capability may be announced in, using "both" as
   a shorthand for "both the AUTHORIZATION and TRANSACTION states".  As
   this document does not introduce a new state when the CAPA command
   may be used, this document does not change the meaning of any
   capabilities registered.

5.  The SLEE Command

   The client sends a SLEE command to complete a TRANSACTION state
   session and transition to the SLEEP state.

   A server that responds to this command with a success +OK response
   MUST have deleted all messages flagged for deletion with DELE (but
   not reverted by RSET) and MUST have transitioned this connection to
   the SLEEP state.  If the server cannot perform these steps, it MUST
   return an error -ERR response, remain in the TRANSACTION state and
   leave the state of the mailbox unchanged.

   The client MUST wait for a response to this command before sending
   any additional commands, regardless of the presence of the PIPELINING
   [RFC2449] capability in the response to the CAPA command.

6.  The WAKE Command

   The client sends a WAKE command as a request to complete a SLEEP
   state session and start a new TRANSACTION state.

   If the server's response is a success +OK, the connection transitions
   to a new TRANSACTION state, as if the client had disconnected,
   reconnected and reauthenticated.  The mailbox MAY have new messages
   and the numeric message-id values assigned to messages MAY have been
   reassigned.

   If the server cannot transition to a new TRANSACTION state, it MUST
   respond with an error -ERR response.  In this case, the connection
   will remain in the SLEEP state.  If the server's CAPA response
   includes the "RESP-CODES" extension [RFC2449] then the server MAY use
   response codes to assist identification of the underlying issue.

   If the service's CAPA response includes "AUTH-RESP-CODE" [RFC3206]
   then the response MAY use the [AUTH] response code to indicate the
   authentication credentials supplied during the AUTHORIZATION state
   are no longer suitable.

   The server MAY use the response code [IN-USE] [RFC2449] to indicate
   access to the mailbox is locked while another entity is making use of
   the mailbox.  Clients MAY try the WAKE command again after a brief
   delay.

   The server MAY use the response code [SYS] (including [SYS/TEMP] and
   [SYS/PERM]) as described in [RFC3206].

7.  The NOOP Command

   The NOOP command is valid during the SLEEP state to keep an idle
   connection open.  It has identical meaning and behavior as defined in
   [RFC1939].

8.  The QUIT Command

   The QUIT command is valid during the SLEEP state to request that the
   underlying connection is closed down.  The server MUST respond with a
   success +OK response and then close the underlying connection down.

   NOTE: As DELE is not one of the commands listed as valid for during
   the SLEEP state and any message deletes will have been committed
   during handling of the SLEE command, the QUIT command's only purpose
   during the SLEEP state is to close down the underlying connection.
   There is no pratical difference in this state between using QUIT and
   closing down the underlying connection from the client side, but the
   client may nonetheless prefer to use the same mechanism to close down
   an open connection which will work in any of the many states.
