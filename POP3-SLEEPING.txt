                       POP3 - SLEEPING Extension
                     draft-billpg-pop3-sleeping-00

Abstract

   An extension to POP3 allowing opened connections to be shelved,
   avoiding the const of repeated TCP and TLS handshakes when polling
   for new messages and for message deletes to be committed without
   having to disconnect.

1.  Introduction

   When polling for new messages in a POP3 [RFC1939] mailbox, both
   client and server need to repeatedly re-negotitate TCP and TLS and
   re-authenticate every time the client attempts to poll for new
   messages.  By allowing a client to keep an underying connection open
   instead of closing it down, the client is at liberty to resume using
   the opened connection at a later time and so avoid the burden of all
   the steps needed to reconnect.

   This document specifies an extension that enables this mode of
   operation.  It introduces a new SLEEP state, alongside the
   established states, with commands to enter and leave this new state.
   During the SLEEP state, the client remains authenticated and the
   underlying connection remains open, but the associated mailbox is
   unlocked and inaccessable.

   The underlying connection that remains open includes the TLS channel
   if present, including if that channel was opened by an explicit STLS
   command [RFC2595] or implied by use of TCP port 995 [RFC8314].

   Furthermore, the command to leave the TRANSACTION state and enter
   SLEEP will also commit any pending message deletes made with the DELE
   command that would otherwise only be committed at the QUIT command.

   POP3 is designed to work on a simple bulk-download-and-delete model,
   eschewing more advanced features such as folder management.  This
   extension is compatible with that model as the high-level operation
   of client and server is unchanged, only adding the ability to shelve
   an opened connection between polls.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Capability

   A service implementing this extension indicates support by including
   the capability "SLEEPING" in response to a CAPA command.

2.1.  SLEEPING Capability

   CAPA tag:
           SLEEPING

   Arguments:
           none

   Added commands:
           SLEE, WAKE

   Announced states / possible differences:
           both / no

   Commands valid in states:
           SLEE in TRANSACTION, WAKE in SLEEP

   Specification reference:
           This document

   Discussion:
           The SLEEPING capability indicates the optional SLEE and WAKE
           commands are available and the SLEEP state is supported.

3.  The SLEEP State

   This RFC introduces the SLEEP state, alongside the established states
   of AUTHORIZATION, TRANSACTION and UPDATE.  An opened connection
   enters the SLEEP state on a +OK success response to a SLEE command
   and leaves it on a +OK response to a WAKE or QUIT command.

   During the SLEEP state, the server MUST support these commands: NOOP,
   QUIT, WAKE.

      NOTE: This document STRONGLY encourages that during a sleep state,
      service implementations return error responses to any command
      other that the three listed above.  This will assist those
      developing clients from wrongly assuming commands such STAT or
      UIDL could be used during a SLEEP state to poll for new messages.

      NOTE: This document STRONGLY encourages those services that place
      a lock on a mailbox during a TRANSACTION state to release those
      locks during a SLEEP state and allow other concurrent requests.
      It is permitted for the WAKE command to fail with a "-ERR [INUSE]"
      failure response if a separate connection has taken the lock for
      the mailbox during the SLEEP state.

3.1.  Considerations for other capabilities

   "CAPA" [RFC2449] is not on the list of commands that are valid to use
   during the SLEEP state.

   Registered capabilities include a statement to which states each
   capability may be announced in, often using "both" as a shorthand for
   "both the AUTHOIZATION and TRANSACTION states".  As this document
   does not introduce a new state when the CAPA command may be used,
   this document does not change the meaning of the capabilities
   registered.

4.  The SLEE Command

   The POP3 SLEE command requests that the POP3 service take the
   following steps:

   *  All actions that take place on a successful QUIT command and
      UPDATE state, except for closing down the channel over which
      commands and responses are sent and received.

   *  The connection transitions to the SLEEP state.

                              POP3-SLEEPING                 October 2022


   If the service cannot perform these steps, it MUST return an error
   (-ERR) response and leave the state of the mailbox and opened
   connection unchanged.

   On the succesful completion of the SLEE command including successful
   transition to the SLEEP state, the service MUST respond with a
   success response (+OK) to indicate to the client it's request was
   succesful.  A client MUST wait for a response before sending
   additional commands, regardless of the PIPELINING capability.

      NOTE: Messages flagged for deletion by DELE [RFC1939] are finally
      deleted by the SLEE command as well as by the QUIT command.  Other
      POP3 extensions might allow for a mailbox to be modifed, but
      similar to DELE, the modification is documented to be diferred
      until committed by a QUIT command.  In this case, those
      modifications would be committed by the SLEE command too.  The
      only difference between SLEE is QUIT is that with SLEE, the
      communciations channel, including TCP and TLS, remain open.
