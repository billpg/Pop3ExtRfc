                       POP3 - SLEEPING Extension
                     draft-billpg-pop3-sleeping-00

Abstract

   An extension to POP3 allowing opened connections to be shelved,
   avoiding the cost of repeated TCP and TLS handshakes when polling for
   new messages and for message deletes to be committed without having
   to disconnect.

1.  Introduction

   When polling for new messages in a POP3 [RFC1939] mailbox, both
   client and server need to repeatedly re-negotitate TCP and TLS and
   re-authenticate every time the client attempts to poll for new
   messages.  By allowing a client to keep an underying connection open
   instead of closing it down, the client is at liberty to resume using
   the opened connection at a later time and so avoid the burden of all
   the steps needed to reconnect.

   This document specifies an extension that enables this mode of
   operation.  It introduces a new SLEEP state, alongside the
   established states, with commands to enter and leave this new state.
   During the SLEEP state, the client remains authenticated and the
   underlying connection remains open, but the associated mailbox is
   unlocked and inaccessable.

   The underlying connection that remains open includes the TLS channel
   if present, including if that channel was opened by an explicit STLS
   command [RFC2595] or implied by use of TCP port 995 [RFC8314].

   Furthermore, the command to leave the TRANSACTION state and enter
   SLEEP will also commit any pending message deletes made with the DELE
   command that would otherwise only be committed at the QUIT command.

   POP3 is designed to work on a simple bulk-download-and-delete model,
   eschewing more advanced features such as folder management.  This
   extension is compatible with that model as the high-level operation
   of client and server is unchanged, only adding the ability to shelve
   an opened connection between polls.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Capability

   A service implementing this extension indicates support by including
   the capability "SLEEPING" in response to a CAPA command.

2.1.  SLEEPING Capability

   CAPA tag:
           SLEEPING

   Arguments:
           none

   Added commands:
           SLEE, WAKE

   Announced states / possible differences:
           both / no

   Commands valid in states:
           SLEE in TRANSACTION, WAKE in SLEEP

   Specification reference:

   Discussion:
           The presence of the "SLEEPING" capability indicates the SLEEP
           state is supported and that the SLEE and WAKE commands are
           supported to enter and leave this new state.

3.  The SLEEP State

   This RFC introduces the SLEEP state, alongside the established states
   of AUTHORIZATION, TRANSACTION and UPDATE.

   During a SLEEP state, the underlying TCP and TLS connections remain
   open and active.  Access tp the mailbox is not possible but the
   client onetheless remains athenticated during this time.

   A client requests an opened connection enters the SLEEP state from
   the TRANSACTION state by a SLEE command.  If the server responds with
   a success +OK respose, the connection MUST exit the TRANSACTION state
   and enter the SLEEP state.  If the server responds with a failure
   -ERR response, the opened connection MUST remain in the TRANSACTION
   stete.

   A client requests an opened connection returns to the TRANSACTION
   state by a WAKE command.  If the server responds with a success +OK
   response, the collection MUST exit the SLEEP state and return to the
   TRANSACION state.  If the server responds with a failure -ERR
   response, the opened connection MUST remain in the SLEEP state.

   During the SLEEP state, the server MUST support these commands: NOOP,
   QUIT, WAKE.

      NOTE: This document STRONGLY encourages that during a sleep state,
      service implementations return error responses to any command
      other that the three listed above.  This will assist those
      developing clients from wrongly assuming commands such STAT or
      UIDL could be used during a SLEEP state to poll for new messages.

      NOTE: This document STRONGLY encourages those services that place
      a lock on a mailbox during a TRANSACTION state to release those
      locks during a SLEEP state and allow other concurrent requests.
      It is permitted for the WAKE command to fail with a "-ERR [INUSE]"
      failure response if a separate connection has taken the lock for
      the mailbox during the SLEEP state.

4.  Considerations for other capabilities

   "CAPA" [RFC2449] is not on the list of commands that are valid to use
   during the SLEEP state.

   Registered capabilities include a statement to which states each
   capability may be announced in, often using "both" as a shorthand for
   "both the AUTHOIZATION and TRANSACTION states".  As this document
   does not introduce a new state when the CAPA command may be used,
   this document does not change the meaning of the capabilities
   registered.

5.  The SLEE Command

   The client sends a SLEE command to complete a TRANSACTION state
   session.  Any messages that were flagged for deletion by DELE (and
   not reverted by RSET) MUST be deleted by the server if it responds
   with a +OK success response.

   The client MUST wait for a response to this command before sending
   any new comands, regardless of the PIPELINING [RFC2449] capability.

   A service that responds with a success +OK response to a SLEE command
   MUST have completed both these steps.  If the service cannot perform
   these steps, it MUST return an error -ERR response and leave the
   state of the mailbox unchnaged.

6.  The WAKE Command

7.  The NOOP Command

8.  The QUIT Command
