# Pop3ExtRfc
Writing formal RFCs for my POP3 extensions.

I've written some extensions to the popular POP3 protocol, but at time of writing, it only exists in the form of a prototype and some informal descriptions. This project's purpose is to take those informal descriptions and turn them into formal RFC documents.

If you have any comments or suggestions for changes, please open an issue on this github project.

# Source Informal Descriptions
